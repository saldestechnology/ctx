    score = normalized_churn x normalized_complexity, where both factors are
    min-max normalized to [0, 1] over the analyzed set (indexed files with at
    least --min-churn commits since --since). If all values are equal, they
    all normalize to 1.0. Raw commit and complexity counts are reported
    alongside the score.

APPROXIMATIONS (v1):
    - With --by symbol, a symbol's churn is approximated by its FILE's commit
      count; per-symbol git history is not tracked yet.
    - Churn is collected with `git log --no-renames`, so renaming a file
      resets its commit count.

    2    operational error (not a git repository, missing index, bad ref)

    #[command(after_help = r#"METRICS (for --fail-on and JSON output):
    complexity_delta    sum over changed files of per-function
                        2*fan_out + same-file fan_in, current - baseline
    fan_out_delta       calls sourced in changed files, current - baseline
    new_duplication     near-duplicate pairs (Jaccard >= 0.85, >= 50 tokens,
                        >= 1 endpoint in a changed file) absent at REF
    check_violations    `ctx check --against REF` violations
                        (0 with a note when .ctx/rules.toml is missing)
    symbols_added       symbols present now but not at REF
    symbols_removed     symbols present at REF but not now
    files_changed       changed source files that were scored

NOTES:
    Baseline metrics come from parsing each changed file's content at REF in
    memory with the same parser; fan-in is approximated as same-file callers
    on both sides so the deltas compare like with like.

EXAMPLES:
    ctx score                        # score uncommitted changes (vs HEAD)
    ctx score --against main         # score the whole branch / PR vs main
    ctx score --against main --fail-on "check_violations>0,new_duplication>0"
    ctx score --fail-on "complexity_delta>=20" --json
